# This is a bash script written for an assignment in my Master's course.
# Script runs a search on logs based on any single criteria the user chooses, i.e. PROTOCOL, SRC IP, SRC PORT, DEST IP, DEST PORT, PACKETS or BYTES.
# The search is to be applied to 1 specific log file that the user will choose from an on-screen list.
# The result of each search conducted by the user are to be exported to a file named as follows â€“ search_results_logfilename_currentdatetime.csv, where logfilename is the name of the log file searched (minus the .csv extension) and currentdatetime is a timestamp generated by the system.
# Search results are only to include those matching rows in the log file that are marked as suspicious. Those marked as normal are to be excluded from the results.
# When the PACKETS or BYTES fields are used as search criteria, totals for each of these should also be calculated and displayed as the final row of the search results printed to the screen.
# All searches are case insensitive.
# User inputs are validated.
# User is able to conduct as many search operations as he wishes without the script terminating. The script runs until the user specifically chooses to terminate it via a menu option.
# Code will not be updated.
